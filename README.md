# windows-game-library
### Multiple command-line games. (only working on Windows because of the <Windows.h> header)

# Requirements

 - Install the [Microsoft Windows SDK](https://developer.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/downloads/windows-sdk/)

 - Make sure your compiler supports threads.
 
~~# Known Issues
 
  - snake is incomplete, you cannot grow, the game never ends
  - if the user decides to lengthen/shorten (compared to the default) the playing area of pong, the numbers will stay in the same place (lazy code moment)
  - minesweeper will become insanely difficult OR easy if the length to height ratio of the board modifies, as the number of mines is relative to the height (the dimensions of the board should be almost, if not equal)
  - uno suffers from spaghetti code~~
# DISCONTINUED
